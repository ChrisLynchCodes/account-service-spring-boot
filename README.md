# account-service-spring-boot

microservice used for storing accounts and fighters. Run as a docker container.


**Technology Stack**: Java 11, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Hibernate, Docker

**Purpose**: This repository contains the account-service component of my microservices architecture. It allows for CRUD operations to be performed on Accounts & Fighters

**Usage**: Other microservices in my ecosystem call the endpoints exposed in this service to interact with the underlying data


***Note*** Originaly intended to use for Accounts hence the name 'account-service' switched to Fighters but I am yet to update the service name to fighter-service
